Learnings from the Module:
In this module, I learned the fundamentals of SQL and how to interact with relational databases using structured queries. I understood how to use commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to manage data effectively. I also learned about filtering data using WHERE clauses, sorting results with ORDER BY, and grouping records using GROUP BY. This module strengthened my understanding of how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated in database systems.
